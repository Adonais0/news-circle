#Heroku deployment - App

From this

Of note
0. you really have to do all this from the django project folder for us its

news-circle/backend/server

1. You really do have to make a new git repo in the django project folder
2. Procfile should look like 

web: gunicorn server.wsgi

Verify its working with

heroku ps:scale web=1

Finally, the ssl workaround at the end of the link above was throwing an error, so we skipped it

#Heroku deployment, migrating db from local

https://medium.com/@BennettGarner/deploying-django-to-heroku-connecting-heroku-postgres-fcc960d290d1

1. create pg dump file (pg_dump -U username dbname > outfile)

from inside the django project folder it loos like this

pg_dump --format=c -U postgres newscircle > db_dumps/newscircle.dump

2. Load the dump file (as a restore) to the database

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-import-export

it involves setting up an S3 bucket 

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3

AWS credentials:

email: murrayn@umich.edu
password: damnkitties!5

Of note:

Access security credentials via main console > account name in upper right >
Security credentials.

Add the newscircle.bak file you created in 1. to the bucket

*Make sure to set permissions so that public as full access

install aws cli here:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html

Generate a signed URL like this (url found by checking box next to uploaded file in S3, reading URL from pop up that appears from the right)

aws s3 presign s3://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/news-circle/newscircle.dump

Finally

heroku pg:backups:restore "https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/news-circle/newscircle.dump" DATABASE_URL --app news-circle

#Deploying Android app for download


0. Get your app set up to be deployed on the play store 

https://android.jlelse.eu/publishing-an-android-app-da3502c652af



1. Generate upload key and keystore
https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#generate-key

1.a Open Android studio and select "open existing project" open the following:

news-circle/platforms/android/app

1.b. after the build, Menu > Build > Analyze APK

THEN

1.c. Menu > Build > Generate signed bundle/APK

Select "APK" choice and hit next

Under Keystore path field click "Create New"

Choose a Keystore path, I chose 

C:\UCAD\news-circle\platforms\android\upload-keystore.jks 

Password: damnkitties!5

Dialog box will pop up asking if you want to generare signed release, click yes. This will create an app release, app-release.apk, to the following path:

C:\UCAD\news-circle\platforms\android\app\release

2. Sign app with your new key

-Change your config.xml file to have a widget id as something different than io.ionic.starter. Find config.xml here:

C:\UCAD\news-circle\platforms\android\app\src\main\res\xml

AND 

C:\UCAD\news-circle\config.xml

THEN copy and paste this config.xml file to the android directory

C:\UCAD\news-circle\platforms\android\config.xml

we used this instead of ionic.io.starter = 'com.test.news-circle'

THEN 

-Close android studio, open android product from C:\UCAD\news-circle\platforms\android

-For good measure: Android Studio > Menu > Build > Rebuild Project

-In Android Studio (make sure project is open to the path specified in step 1.a.), Menu > Build > Generate Signed Bundle or APK

-Module: app
-Key store path: C:\UCAD\news-circle\platforms\android\upload-keystore.jks
-Hit Next
-Select release, and check both boxes (V2 and V1)

-Hit Analyze APK in the window that appears at the end make sure app is labeled com.test.news_circle

3. Upload your APK to the Google developer console

-In Console, select "App reelases" on the left

-Select Open track (Beta) > Create Release

Upload your .apk from 
C:\UCAD\news-circle\platforms\android\app\release

FOR SIMPLE DOWNLOAD

-Just add the file to our S3 bucket, making permissions public. File will be available for download at this address

http://news-circle.s3.amazonaws.com/app-release.apk


RE-DEPLOYING FOR DOWNLOAD AFTER UPDATE

-make sure to increment up the version number in "C:\UCAD\news-circle\platforms\android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml"

FOR THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE

4. Complete the checklist items on the left till they're all green.
